# 如何強化大型語言模型的能力？就算你訓練不了AI (How to improve LLM performance without training?)

## Overview
This video discusses how to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) without training them. It emphasizes that while training models is beneficial, there are ways to leverage existing models more effectively by focusing on prompt engineering and providing relevant context. The speaker highlights techniques like using "magic spells" (specific prompts), providing sufficient information, and utilizing in-context learning to guide the model toward desired outputs.

## Detailed Summary
The video begins by clarifying that the session focuses on techniques to enhance LLM performance without actually training the models. It dispels the notion that writing prompts for specific tasks requires extensive learning, as modern LLMs are generally robust and can understand various phrasing styles. The speaker likens LLMs to "newbie assistants" who possess general knowledge but lack specific details about the user, emphasizing the importance of providing sufficient context.

The core of the presentation revolves around five approaches to improve LLM performance without training. First, the speaker introduces the concept of "magic spells," such as "Chain of Thought" (COT), which involves instructing the model to "think step by step." This can significantly improve performance on tasks like solving math problems. However, the speaker cautions that these spells are not universally effective and their impact can vary depending on the model. Another magic spell is to ask the model to explain its answer, which can improve accuracy. The speaker also mentions "emotional blackmail" as a surprisingly effective technique in some cases. The video then mentions the paper "Principle Instruction Are All You Need" that explores different prompting strategies.

Next, the video discusses providing more information to the model. This includes clarifying the user's assumptions and providing relevant knowledge that the model may lack. For instance, if the model is unaware that "NTU" can refer to National Taiwan University, providing the context that the user is Taiwanese can lead to a more accurate response. The speaker also demonstrates how to provide the model with the content of research papers to extract specific information. The technique of in-context learning, which involves providing examples to guide the model, is also explored. The video discusses how the latest models are much better at understanding the examples provided.

## Key Points
- Specific prompts or "magic spells" like "Let's think step by step" (Chain of Thought) can significantly improve LLM performance on certain tasks.
- Asking the model to explain its reasoning can increase the accuracy of its responses.
- Providing sufficient context and clarifying assumptions can help the model understand the user's intent and provide more accurate answers.
- Supplying relevant information or documents can bridge knowledge gaps and enable the model to perform tasks it couldn't otherwise handle.
- In-context learning, where examples are provided to guide the model, is an effective technique for improving performance, and newer models are better at understanding the examples.
- LLMs can even be prompted to generate stronger prompts.

## Conclusion
The video concludes by emphasizing that while training LLMs is a powerful approach, there are various techniques to improve their performance without training. By focusing on prompt engineering, providing sufficient context, and utilizing in-context learning, users can leverage existing models more effectively and achieve desired outcomes.

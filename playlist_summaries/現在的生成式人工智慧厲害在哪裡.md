# 現在的生成式人工智慧厲害在哪裡

## Overview
This video discusses the evolution of generative AI, highlighting the differences between older, specialized AI like Google Translate and newer, more versatile AI models like ChatGPT. It explores the capabilities of these new models, their potential issues, and how users can adapt to effectively utilize them. The video also touches on the idea of training custom AI models and introduces the concept of Prompt Engineering.

## Detailed Summary
The video begins by explaining that while generative AI isn't new, recent advancements have led to its widespread adoption. Older generative AI, like Google Translate, had a single, specialized function. In contrast, newer models like ChatGPT lack a specific purpose and require explicit instructions to perform tasks, making them more akin to a "tool person" rather than a simple tool.

The lecture highlights several versatile generative AI models, including Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, and Anthropic's Claude, but focuses primarily on ChatGPT due to its comprehensive capabilities. It differentiates between the free GPT-3.5 and the paid GPT-4, emphasizing the latter's advanced features like file and image reading, internet search, code execution, and customizability. While GPT-4 is more powerful, the instructor encourages users to test its capabilities before dismissing AI's potential.

The video showcases the diverse range of tasks ChatGPT can perform, from text generation and technical problem-solving to providing health and travel advice. It demonstrates how to use ChatGPT to generate a word cloud, illustrating its ability to write and execute code. The instructor shares a "mindset" for using ChatGPT, advising users to ask what they want ChatGPT to do rather than what it can do, emphasizing the importance of precise prompts. The video also touches upon the ethical implications of these powerful AI models, including potential biases and the need for careful evaluation.

## Key Points
- Generative AI has evolved from specialized tools to versatile "tool people" like ChatGPT.
- ChatGPT's capabilities are broad, including text generation, problem-solving, and code execution.
- GPT-4 offers advanced features compared to the free GPT-3.5 version.
- Effective use of ChatGPT requires well-defined prompts and clear instructions.
- Evaluating the capabilities of comprehensive AI models is complex due to the diversity of potential tasks and solutions.
- There are ethical concerns regarding bias, harmful content generation, and the need for robust evaluation methods.
- Users can adapt to AI by refining their prompts (Prompt Engineering) or by training custom models.

## Conclusion
The video concludes by emphasizing the transformative potential of modern generative AI. It acknowledges the challenges and ethical considerations that arise with these powerful tools but encourages viewers to embrace the opportunities for collaboration and innovation. The video sets the stage for future discussions on prompt engineering and custom model training, suggesting that adapting to and shaping these technologies is crucial for navigating the future landscape of AI.

# 什麼是生成式人工智慧 (What is Generative AI?)

## Overview
This video introduces the concept of Generative AI, starting with a discussion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its somewhat ambiguous definition. It then delves into the more specific definition of Generative AI, explaining its core function of creating complex and structured objects like text, images, and audio. The video also differentiates Generative AI from classification problems and touches upon the role of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and models in achieving Generative AI. Finally, it hints at the underlying mechanism of ChatGPT, focusing on the idea of "text completion" and language models, while also providing a historical perspective on the development of Generative AI.

## Detailed Summary
The video begins by acknowledging the lack of a standard definition for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Different people have different expectations of what constitutes AI, making it a somewhat abstract concept. In academic papers, the term AI is often avoided due to its lack of a clear definition. However, AI can be considered a goal – the aim to create machines that exhibit intelligence.

The presenter then transitions into the definition of Generative AI, which is more concrete. Generative AI is about enabling machines to produce complex and structured objects like articles, images, and audio. The complexity is such that the possible outputs are virtually infinite. As an example, the presenter describes the number of possible 100-character articles that can be written using 1000 Chinese characters as a base. This number is so large (10 to the power of 300) that it far exceeds the estimated number of atoms in the universe. This illustrates the immense complexity involved in Generative AI tasks. The video contrasts Generative AI with classification, where machines select from a limited set of options.

The video also introduces Machine Learning (ML) as a means to achieve AI, where machines automatically learn a function from data. This is illustrated with a basic algebra problem from middle school. The difference is that, instead of a human manually solving for the parameters, machine learning algorithms automatically determine the parameters from input data. The video uses the example of teaching a machine to distinguish between cats and dogs using images. This requires a complex function with potentially thousands of parameters. Such a function with numerous parameters is referred to as a "model," often represented as a neural network in the context of Deep Learning. Deep Learning is presented as a type of Machine Learning that utilizes neural networks. The video also shows how Generative AI is a goal that can be achieved using Machine Learning methods like Deep Learning.

The video then discusses how Generative AI models like ChatGPT are built. ChatGPT can be seen as a function that takes text input and produces a text response. It is hinted that ChatGPT uses a model called Transformer, containing billions of parameters, which is trained on massive amounts of text data to learn the relationships between inputs and outputs. Similarly, image generation AIs like Stable Diffusion or Midjourney take text descriptions as input and output images, also relying on complex models trained on vast datasets. The video touches on the challenges of collecting enough training data for Generative AI because the machine may need to create entirely new content that was not present in the original training data.

Finally, the video introduces the idea of "text completion" as the core mechanism of ChatGPT. Rather than generating an entire response at once, ChatGPT predicts the next word in a sequence and then appends it to the existing sequence before repeating the process. This is known as a language model and is a type of classification problem because the model is choosing the next word from a finite set of options. This "auto-regressive generation" approach transforms the difficult task of generating complex content into a series of simpler text completion tasks. The video concludes by noting that Generative AI has been around for a while, citing Google Translate as an example, and teases the reasons for its recent surge in popularity.
